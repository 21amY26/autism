Autism Detection Website
Overview
The Autism Detection Website is a platform that evaluates the likelihood of autism in individuals based on their attention span while viewing specific images. The site features a login/signup system for user authentication and securely manages user information. The analysis is non-invasive and leverages user behavior to generate results.

Features
User Authentication:
Includes a signup and login system to manage user accounts. The application ensures secure handling of user data with features like password encryption and session management.

Autism Detection:
The detection process involves presenting users with two sets of images. The system records the time spent focusing on each image and analyzes these attention spans to assess the likelihood of autism.

Result Analysis:
The application uses predefined thresholds to analyze attention data. Results are displayed to users in an easy-to-understand format, categorizing the likelihood of autism as high, low, or none.

User-Friendly Design:
A clean and intuitive interface guides users through the test, ensuring accessibility for individuals of all backgrounds.

Database Integration:
The website securely stores user data and test results in a database, enabling record keeping and personalized experiences.

Scalable Infrastructure:
Built using modern web technologies, the website is designed for both local and production environments, ensuring flexibility and reliability.

How It Works
User Interaction:
Users sign up or log in to begin the test. The application tracks their behavior during the test.

Image Test Rounds:
Two rounds of tests are conducted, each displaying a pair of images. The application measures the user's attention span for each image.

Data Analysis:
The attention spans are compared against predefined benchmarks to derive insights.

Result Presentation:
The final report is displayed, summarizing the user's likelihood of autism based on the collected data.

Usage Flow
Accessing the Website:
Users navigate to the site and sign up or log in to their accounts.

Taking the Test:
After logging in, users can start the test, where they are shown images for evaluation.

Viewing Results:
Once the test is completed, users receive a detailed analysis of their attention span data.

Next Steps:
Users can use the insights for further consultation or revisit the test as needed.

Benefits
Non-Invasive:
The system does not require direct interaction or physical tests, making it safe and user-friendly.

Accessible:
The website is designed to be inclusive and straightforward, ensuring usability for a wide audience.

Data-Driven Insights:
By analyzing attention spans, the application provides scientifically backed indications of autism likelihood.

Deployment and Maintenance
The website is built with scalability in mind, allowing it to run locally or be deployed to a production environment. Regular updates and maintenance ensure the platform remains secure and efficient.
